Hello, I’m @DrDoctorpus but most people call me Leon, I’m not actually an octopus or a doctor so don’t ask me for medical advice, especially if you are an octopus.

I am currently studying a BSc in Computing and IT with a focus on Computer science. Previously I have studied for two years as part of a 
BTEC subsidiary diploma in electrical engineering. In terms of programming languages I am currently a beginner with Python 
but I will be learning Java at some point down the line. I am here to learn so any constructive criticism is more than welcome.
